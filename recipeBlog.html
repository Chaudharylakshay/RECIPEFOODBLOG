        <h2>samosa</h2>
        <p>The samosa is prepared with an all-purpose flour (locally known as maida) and stuffed with a filling, often a mixture of diced and cooked or mashed boiled potato, onions, green peas, lentils, ginger, spices and green chili.[19][20] A samosa can be vegetarian or non-vegetarian, depending on the filling. The entire pastry is deep-fried in vegetable oil or (rarely) ghee to a golden brown. It is served hot, often with fresh green chutney, such as mint or coriander chutney, or tamarind chutney. It can also be prepared in a sweet form. Samosas are often served in chaat (a type of street food), along with the traditional accompaniments of either a chickpea or a white pea preparation, drizzled with yogurt, tamarind chutney and green chutney, and garnished with chopped onions, coriander, and chaat masala.</p>

        <h2>Burger</h2>
        <p>Who doesn't love a juicy chargrilled beef burger loaded with melted cheese, tangy pickles and fresh crispy vegetables? I know my family does, which is why I often find myself making these insanely melt-in-the-mouth burgers on the regular. They are so easy to make and super low-cost and only require one pan (or a barbecue!) and 22 minutes  brilliant! I sometimes hide extra chopped veggies in the burgers to up the nutrition factor, and using breadcrumbs in the mix ensures the patties are impossible to dry out or get wrong. I often make more patties than I need as they are freezer-friendly and also make great lunchbox fillers.</p>

        <h2>Rasgulla</h2>
        <p>Rasgulla is a popular Bengali sweet made from milk as main ingredient. It is made by curdling milk draining the whey water, collecting the milk solids also called as chenna. This chenna is kneaded well until soft to make balls and then cooked in hot sugar syrup. The balls double in size when cooked in sugar syrup until soft and spongy.I reserved few rasgulla for making rasamalai the next day. I always prefer to use curd instead of lemon to curdle milk as I feel adding lemon juice gives a lemony after taste. I made it almost 6 months back so while writing this post I feel tempted to try again.Rasgulla is a popular Bengali sweet which is my all time favorite but only after rasmalai. Rasgulla is a juicy milk based sweet that is so popular all over the world.
